Resolution

















What's the Resolution inference rule?


	(P or A) and (not P or B) => (A or B)



Why is Resolution a valid rule?


	both (P or A) and (not P or B) must be true
	if P is false, A must be true
	if P is true, B must be true
	so either A or B must be true



Why is Resolution such a great rule?


	resolution by itself is complete
	one rule is all you need



















How do you do proofs using resolution?


	1. negate the conclusion, add it to the premises
	2. convert the premises to clauses (product of sums)
	3. repeatedly apply resolution
	4. the goal is to arrive at false



How do you convert expressions to clauses?


	1. remove -> and <->
	2. push NOTs (DeMorgans)
	3. distribute ORs over ANDs



Show how to convert the expression to clauses.


	(A or B) -> C



















Prove the argument using resolution and contradiction.

	There is an undeclared variable or
	there is a syntax error.
	If there is a syntax error,
	there is a missing semicolon or
	a variable name is misspelled.
	There is not a missing semicolon.
	There is not a misspelled variable name.
	Therefore there is an undeclared variable.

	U  undeclared variable
	E  syntax error
	S  missing semicolon
	V  misspelled variable name

	premises:
		U or E
		E -> (S or V)
		not S
		not V

	conclusion:
		U



















Classwork
You may work with a partner.

Prove the argument using resolution and contradiction.

	If the house is next to a lake,
	the treasure is not in the kitchen.
	If the tree in the yard is an elm,
	the treasure is in the kitchen.
	The house is next to a lake.
	The tree in the yard is an elm or
	the treasure is buried under the flagpole.
	Therefore the treasure is under the flagpole.

	L  house is next to lake
	K  treasure is in kitchen
	E  tree is an elm
	P  treasure is under flagpole

	premises:
		L -> not K
		E -> K
		L
		E or P

	conclusion:
		P
