Proofs using Facts and Rules



















How do Facts, Rules, and Queries relate to predicate logic?


	1. facts and rules are premises
	2. queries are conclusions



Translate the argument into predicate logic.


	All students love pizza.
	Bob is a student.
	Therefore, Bob loves pizza.



Translate the argument into facts, rules, and queries.


	All students love pizza.
	Bob is a student.
	Therefore, Bob loves pizza.



What type of quantifier applies to the variables in a rule?


	variables in a rule are implicitly universally quantified



















Prove the query using the facts and rules.


	facts:	  S(Bob)
	rules:	  P(x) :- S(x)
	queries:  P(Bob)



















Prove the query using the facts and rules.


	facts:	   sister(ann, bob)
		   parent(bob, jay)
	rules:	   aunt(x,z) :- sister(x,y), parent(y,z)
	queries:   aunt(ann, jay)



















Classwork
You may work with a partner.


Prove the query using the facts and rules.


	facts:	 married(jim, bea)
		 child(ned, bea)
	rules:	 married(y,x) :- married(x,y)
		 child(x,z) :- child(x,y), married(y,z)
	queries: child(ned, jim)



















Unification



How do you use rules in a proof?


	1. match each predicate in the body with a fact
	2. assert the head as a new true statement



How do you get facts and rules to match?


	unification



What's Unification?


	find instantiations that make expressions match



What's the unifier for each pair of expressions?


	mother(Jane, Brent) and sister(Liza, Jane)
	mother(x,y) and sister(z,x) -> aunt(z,y)


	plus(X, 0, X)
	plus(4, Z, Y)


	plus(X, 0, X)
	plus(3, Z, 4)
