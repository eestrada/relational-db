Valid Expressions



What's a Valid Expression?


	1. always true regardless of predicate or domain definitions

	2. also called a tautology



Which of the expressions are valid?


	(all x)cat(x) -> (exists x)cat(x)

	(all x)cat(x) -> cat(Tom)

	(all x)(cat(x) and blue(x)) -> (all x)cat(x) and (all x)blue(x)



















Classwork
You may work with a partner.


Which of the expressions are valid?


	cat(Tom) -> (exists x)cat(x)

	(exists x)cat(x) -> (all x)cat(x)

	(all x)(cat(x) or blue(x)) -> (all x)cat(x) or (all x)blue(x)





















Predicate Logic Equivalences


Distributive (x can't be a free variable in B)

(all x)A or B		<=>  (all x)(A or B)
(exists x)A and B	<=>  (exists x)(A and B)


Commutative and Associative

(all x)(A and B)	<=>  (all x)A and (all x)B
(exists x)(A or B)	<=>  (exists x)A or (exists x)B

(all x)(all y)A	   	<=>  (all y)(all x)A
(exists x)(exists y)A  	<=>  (exists y)(exists x)A


DeMorgan's

not ((all x)A)		<=>  (exists x)(not A)
not ((exists x)A)	<=>  (all x)(not A)

















Use algebra to show the equivalence is valid.


	(exists x)P(x) -> Q <=> (all x)(P(x) -> Q)

Use algebra to show the equivalence is valid.


	not (exists x) (A(x) and (B(x) or C(x))) <=>
	(all x) (A(x) -> (not B(x) and not C(x)))
