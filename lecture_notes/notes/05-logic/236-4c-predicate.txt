Predicates

















Is the argument valid?
Can you prove it using propositional logic?


	All students love pizza.
	Bob is a student.
	Therefore, Bob loves pizza.


You need predicates and quantifiers.


















Write the statements using predicates.


	Bob is a student.

	Mary and Paul are siblings.





What do you need to know to be able to evaluate the expression?


	son(Jim, Bob)



















The following facts define when the son(X,Y) predicate is true.
The predicate is false for all other cases.


	son(Bob, Jim)
	son(Jim, Joe)


What's the truth value for each expression?


	son(Jim, Bob)
	son(Bob, Jim)
	son(Bob, Joe) and son(Jim, Joe)
	son(Bob, Joe) or son(Jim, Joe)


What do you need to know to be able to evaluate the expression?
What's the truth value?


	son(Jim, X)

















Universal Quantifier (for all)


What do the expressions mean?


	(all x) student(x)

	(all y) (student(y) -> smart(y))


What does the upside down A symbol mean?


	(all x) P(x)

	1. P(x) is true for every x in the Domain

	2. P(Bob) and P(Jim) and P(Joe)
	   (if the domain is {Bob, Jim, Joe})


What do you need to know to be able to evaluate the expression?


	(all X) son(Jim, X)



















The following facts define when the son(X,Y) predicate is true.
The predicate is false for all other cases.

The domain is {Bob, Jim, Joe}.


	son(Bob, Jim)
	son(Jim, Joe)


What's the truth value for each expression?


	(all X) son(Jim, X)
	(all X) not son(Jim, X)
	(all X) not son(X, Bob)




















Existential Quantifier (there exists)


What do the expressions mean?


	(exists x) student(x)

	(exists y) (student(y) and smart(y))


What does the backwards E symbol mean?


	(exists x) P(x)

	1. P(x) is true for at least one value in the Domain

	2. P(Bob) or P(Jim) or P(Joe)
	   (if the domain is {Bob, Jim, Joe})


What do you need to know to be able to evaluate the expression?


	(exists X) son(Jim, X)



















The following facts define when the son(X,Y) predicate is true.
The predicate is false for all other cases.

The domain is {Bob, Jim, Joe}.


	son(Bob, Jim)
	son(Jim, Joe)


What's the truth value for each expression?


	(exists X) son(Jim, X)
	(exists X) not son(Jim, X)
	(exists X) son(X, Bob)




















Nested Quantifiers



Does order matter for Quantifiers?

Is (all x)(exists y) different from (exists y)(all x)?



Rewrite each expression without quantifiers.

Use the domain {Bob, Jim}.


	(exists x)(all y) son(x,y)

	(all y)(exists x) son(x,y)


	(son(Bob,Bob) and son(Bob,Jim)) or (son(Jim,Bob) and son(Jim,Jim))

	(son(Bob,Bob) or son(Jim,Bob)) and (son(Bob,Jim) or son(Jim,Jim))

















What do the expressions mean?


	(all x)(exists y) loves(x,y)

	(all y)(exists x) loves(x,y)

	(exists x)(all y) loves(x,y)

	(exists y)(all x) loves(x,y)
















What's the truth value for each expression?

The domain is people in the real world.
The predicate mother(X,Y) is X is the mother of Y.
The predicate male(X) is X is male.
The predicate female(X) is X is female.


	(all x)(exists y) mother(x,y)

	(exists x)(all y) mother(x,y)

	(exists x)(exists y) (mother(x,y) and male(y))

















Classwork
You may work with a partner.

What's the truth value for each expression?


	(all y)(exists x) mother(x,y)

	(exists x)(all y) (mother(x,y) -> female(y))

	(all x)(all y) (mother(x,y) -> male(y))
