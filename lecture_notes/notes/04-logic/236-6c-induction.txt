Proof by Induction



















Suppose you want to prove that (for any positive integer n):


	The sum of the first n positive odd integers is n-squared.



Can you prove a Specific Case (Basis or Base) such as when n is 1?


	when n is 1
	   the sum of the first n positive odd integers is 1
	   n-squared is 1
	the statement is true when n is 1


	when n is 2
	   the sum of the first n positive odd integers is 1+3=4
	   n-squared is 4
	the statement is true when n is 2


	when n is 3
	   the sum of the first n positive odd integers is 1+3+5=9
	   n-squared is 9
	the statement is true when n is 3



















Suppose you could prove a General Step (Inductive Step).

Suppose you could prove that if the statement is true for k,
then the statement is true for k+1.

What would this allow you to conclude when combined with the basis?


	1. the basis says its true when n is 1

	2. if it's true when n is 1, then it's true when n is 2
	   conclude it's true when n is 2

	3. if it's true when n is 2, then it's true when n is 3
	   conclude it's true when n is 3

	4. ...



















How do you prove the General Step?

Suppose P(n) represents the statement:
The sum of the first n positive odd integers is n-squared.

To prove the General Step (Inductive Step) you need to prove
that for all k >= 1, P(k) -> P(k+1).



How do you prove an implication such as this?


	1. assume P(k) is true (inductive hypothesis)

	2. use the assumption to prove P(k+1) is true



What do you get to assume?
(The kth positive odd integer is 2k-1.)



What do you need to prove?



How do you prove it using the assumption?



How do you conclude the proof?


	state the conclusion like this:

	Since the statement is true when n is 1
	and P(k) -> P(k+1) for all k >= 1,
	we conclude that P(n) is true for all n >= 1.



















What's the Principle of Mathematical Induction?


	P(1), P(k) -> P(k+1) => P(n)



What are the steps needed for a Proof by Induction?


	1. prove the base case.
	2. assume P(k).
	3. prove P(k+1).
