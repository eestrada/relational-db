Proof by Deduction



















What's a Valid Argument?

	the conclusion follows from the premises

	if the premises are true, the conclusion is true

	'(conjunction of premises) -> (conclusion)' is a tautology

	(P -> Q, P) -> Q



What's a Fallacy?

	an invalid argument

	(P -> Q, not P) -> not Q


















How do you show that an argument is valid?


	1. write each premise on a line
	2. use inference rules to write new lines
	3. eventually write the conclusion on a line



What Inference Rules can you use?

	A, A -> B	=>  B		Modus Ponens
	not B, A -> B	=>  not A	Modus Tollens
	A -> B, B -> C	=>  A -> C	Hypothetical Syllogism
	A or B, not A	=>  B		Disjunctive Syllogism
	A		=>  A or B	Addition
	A and B		=>  A		Simplification
	A, B		=>  A and B	Conjunction



How are Inference Rules different from Logical Equivalences?



How do you use Logical Equivalences as Inference Rules?

	For an equivalence P <=> Q
	you have two inference rules: P => Q, Q => P


















Give a deductive proof for the argument.


	There is an undeclared variable or
	there is a syntax error.
	If there is a syntax error,
	there is a missing semicolon or
	a variable name is misspelled.
	There is not a missing semicolon.
	There is not a misspelled variable name.
	Therefore there is an undeclared variable.


	U  undeclared variable
	E  syntax error
	S  missing semicolon
	V  misspelled variable name



Does this mean you have proven that there is an undeclared variable?

















Classwork
You may work with a partner.

Give a deductive proof for the argument.


	If the house is next to a lake,
	the treasure is not in the kitchen.
	If the tree in the yard is an elm,
	the treasure is in the kitchen.
	The house is next to a lake.
	The tree in the yard is an elm or
	the treasure is buried under the flagpole.
	Therefore the treasure is under the flagpole.


	L  house is next to lake
	K  treasure is in kitchen
	E  tree is an elm
	P  treasure is under flagpole
