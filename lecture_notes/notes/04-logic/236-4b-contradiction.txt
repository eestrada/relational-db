Proof by Contradiction



How do you show that an argument is valid by contradiction?


	1. negate the conclusion
	2. add the negated conclusion to the premises
	3. apply inference rules to arrive at a contradiction



















Prove the argument using proof by contradiction.


	There is an undeclared variable or
	there is a syntax error.
	If there is a syntax error,
	there is a missing semicolon or
	a variable name is misspelled.
	There is not a missing semicolon.
	There is not a misspelled variable name.
	Therefore there is an undeclared variable.


	U  undeclared variable
	E  syntax error
	S  missing semicolon
	V  misspelled variable name

Prove the argument using proof by contradiction.


	If the house is next to a lake,
	the treasure is not in the kitchen.
	If the tree in the yard is an elm,
	the treasure is in the kitchen.
	The house is next to a lake.
	The tree in the yard is an elm or
	the treasure is buried under the flagpole.
	Therefore the treasure is under the flagpole.


	L  house is next to lake
	K  treasure is in kitchen
	E  tree is an elm
	P  treasure is under flagpole
