What are the Logical Connectives?


	Negation	not ! ~
	Conjunction	and * ^
	Disjunction	or + v
	Implication	->	(conditional)
	Equivalence	<->	(biconditional)


	P Q  ~P  P^Q  PvQ  P->Q  P<->Q
	T T   F	  T    T    T	   T
	T F   F	  F    T    F	   F
	F T   T	  F    T    T	   F

The Conditional (P -> Q)


P is called the hypothesis or antecedent.

Q is called the conclusion or consequent.


Why is the conditional true when the hypothesis is false?

	If you win, I'll give you a cookie.


Why is the contrapositive equivalent to the original statement?

	If I won't give you a cookie, you didn't win.


Why is the inverse not equivalent to the original statement?

	If you don't win, I won't give you a cookie.


Why is the converse not equivalent to the original statement?

	If I'll give you a cookie, you won.


What other English statements say the same thing as if P then Q?

	P implies Q
	P only if Q
	P is sufficient for Q

	Q if P
	Q is necessary for P

	Your winning implies I'll give you a cookie.
	You won only if I'll give you a cookie.
	Your winning is sufficient for me to give you a cookie.

	I'll give you a cookie if you win.
	Giving you a cookie is necessary for your winning.


















The Biconditional (P <-> Q)


Why is Equivalence also called the Biconditional?

	(P <-> Q) is the same as (P->Q) and (Q->P)


How do you pronounce <-> or iff?
